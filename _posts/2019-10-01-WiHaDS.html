<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Project started in 2017 for initiative of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameh-m-8575a3179/">Sameh Megrhi</a><br>

    <blockquote> <p>The purpose of this group is to highlight the advances of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Health. We would like to give weight to profiles of women who have made significant contributions in this field in order to promote the place of women in this sector, which is still too often represented by men.</p>
    <p>WiHADS meetup will engage data scientists, industry experts, researchers, medical.
        We set out to portray, encourage the community to discuss and share knowledge and experiences to help solve the most complex issues around data, analytics, privacy, standards, quality of care and discuss perspectives of the evolving use of Big Data in and healthcare and, to examine opportunities and challenges.

</p>

<p>Since 2017 four meetup evenings took place in Paris and we are not stopping there!</p>
<p><b>Join us at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Healthcare-Analytics-Data-Science/">our meetup webpage</a></b></p>


<h3>The idea</h3>

<p>The field of Data and Analytics is expanding in all sectors. It will have impact on the future of Economy, Education and Healthcare. Holding Ph.D. in Systems Biology and helping to solve Machine Learning problems in academia and pharma, I could observe how it is in the healthcare sector and the impact it can have on people lives.</p>

<p>My motivation for joining WiHADS in 2018 was to promote women role models, to learn from their experience and share our point of views. Also to build a strong professional network and help early-career women forge their path.</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameh-m-8575a3179/">Sameh Megrhi</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imen-helali-phd-a6a4222b/"> Imen Helali</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avani-tanna-b20b8a77/">Avani Tanna</a> we developed our meetup formulae of 2-3 speakers, buffet and then round table debate.</p>
<p>We hosted women speakers from IQvia, Doctolib, PhP, Cardiologs, Dr.Data.</p>
<p>Our organisation it fully pro-bono, entrance is free, place and food are provided thanks to our great sponsors. Our sponsors were: Doctolib, IQvia, Saegus.</p>
