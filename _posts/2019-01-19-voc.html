	<h3>Have you ever felt like you don't know how to put accurate words on your
		ideas when speaking with a business person?</h3>
	<p><em>If like me you have been within the academic universe for some time
			and have tried to get a job in the private sector, you have probably
			realized it is not always easy to understand each other.

			On one side of the barrier, researchers and engineers. On the other,
			business professionals. Both species originating from the common
			Homo Sapiens Sapiens but which have developed divergent vocabulary
			and related behavior because of the environmental pressure.

			<strong>Jokes apart, the language of science and business are quite
				different and worth exploring.</strong>
		</em></p>

	<p>To begin with, let's compare the environment. In academia, the goal is to
		excel in some aspect and to be more innovative and original than others.
		This is why words commonly used (and overused) related to this aspect are:
		<b>novel</b>, <b>insight</b>, <b>paradigm</b>, <b>extremely</b>,
		<b>elucidate</b> and <b>robust</b>. The research often aims to
		understand and describe things, this is why it is common to talk about
		<b>landscapes</b> and
		<b>frameworks</b>. What counts is the global impact of the work, how
		broad it is. There is usually a hypothesis somewhere on the line,
		uncertainty that needs to be acknowledged to avoid the critics with
		<b>putative</b>, <b>respectively</b>,
		<b>potentially</b>. </p>

	site.baseurl}}/images/boss.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

	<p>It is also common to use <em>we</em> even for a one-person task or
		overusing the passive voice. This use of <em>we</em> often sounds odd to
		business people and results in an uncertainty of which part of the project
		you actually did yourself. </p>
	<h3>Critical attitude</h3>


	<p>
		Researches are trained to keep their critical spirit awake and challenge
		each other. One of the first things I was told at a 'how to get a job'
		workshop for PhDs was to <b>be less critical</b>. When I listen to my
		colleagues who are now working in business, I often hear phrases like
		<b>opportunities for improvement</b> used instead of phrases like
		<i>pitfalls</i>. When something is not working, it would be said that it
		is <b>in development</b>, <b>with growth potential</b>. Spending longer
		than usual to understand a complex case is an investment in the company
		knowledge capital. Even firing employees can be called restructuring
		Like it or not, attitude is different and working in a corporate
		universe means you should try to fit in and formulate your critiques
		with prudence.
	</p>
	<h3>Working culture</h3>

	<p>Corporate people often prefer fast (and sometimes ugly) solutions, that
		minimize time and maximize profit. This why words such as <b>ballpark</b>
		are often used. <b>Itemize</b>, <b>prioritize</b>, <b>agile</b>,
		<b>takeaways</b> show that time and task management plays an important role
		in the work culture. Another type of expressions are <b>incentivize</b>,
		<b>proactive</b>, <b>repurpose</b>, it reflects how dynamic the corporate
		world is. You are required to act and react quickly, find solutions rather
		than questions. It is common to talk about <b>empowerment</b> and
		<b>leverage</b> when discussing strategy, words that are rare in
		academia. Business is about money, therefore some expressions higlight
		value, profit, and material gains; such as <b>push the envelope</b> and
		<b>added value</b>. </p>

	<blockquote>The difference in wording reflects different attitudes and
		methods used in business and research worlds. This does not mean that skills
		gained in one universe cannot be useful in the another. However, the
		competence one gains in research needs to be worded in a way it can be
		understood and considered useful in the corporate world.
		<span class="highlightme">
			<b>The skill of making yourself understood can really help foster a
				smooth transition into the business world.</b> Communication, in
			general, is a very important skill for any team and a key factor for
			company success. </span>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		A researcher, even when working in a team, is responsible for his
		project from A to Z. He or she communicates with other researches that
		already have a lot of knowledge about your topic. Conversely, in the
		corporate world, your work is just a part of a bigger process and so you
		need to properly communicate and document your work. This is why a lot
		of place in the corporate vernacular is given to the organization of
		work and management.
	</p>

	<h3>
		CV writing
	</h3>
	<p>
		Your journey to the corporate world start with a CV. A researcher's CV
		is usually a very complete and long list of projects, contributions,
		presentations and publications in a chronological order. The CV you will
		send to hiring managers in the private sector should be quite different.
		Even though writing CVs is a whole different subject, I can advise you
		to follow the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/google-exec-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2014-9">Google
			recommendations</a> for tech jobs at least. The format and wording of
		your CV should be inspired by the corporate world and speak in a
		business tone. For example, instead of writing 'Studied system X in
		conditions A, B and published a paper entitled Novel landscape of system
		X indicates [very long technical word] in conditions A, B', you can
		write: 'Achieved Z/Improved by Z/Discovered Z when studying the system
		X'. You should also add your logistical duties of the project for
		example 'Managed a team of N people/ (international) project' or
		'Monthly reported progress to an international commission in a form of
		dashboards and [format] presentations'.


	</p>

	<p>In the research world, the second wording may sound unnatural. Also, no
		one cares if and how you were reporting or managing your project if you
		published a great paper. In the private sector, the fixation over the
		publications is not well understood so it is hard for them to see what
		skills it takes to publish a journal paper. This is why such an achievement
		needs to decomposed in smaller tasks that can be understood and valued. </p>

	site.baseurl}}/images/work.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

	<h3>
		Tell me about your research
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you have never prepared an answer to this question, practice on your
		non-academic friends and/or family members, usually you lose your
		listener in the first two sentences. Start your response with why not with
		how, focus on the big picture, avoid technical words, scientific names
		and try to make parallels with every day or business life. You should
		always adapt your vocabulary to your interlocutor. Do not be afraid to
		speak too broadly, you can always go into specifics if they ask for more
		details on certain aspects that you mention in your pitch. To get
		inspired with short presentation format, you can have a look at
		guidelines for <a href="http://thepostdocway.com/content/elevator-pitches-scientists-what-when-where-and-how">elevator
			pitch </a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/threeminutethesis">3MT</a> videos.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Presentations
	</h3>

	<p>Another form of communication often used in the business world are
		presentations, usually with support slides. In the private sector, presentations
		are used a lot. And if you think that the content matters more than the form,
		you are right. But, the <b>form is very important</b>, much much more than in
		scientific word. The purpose of presentations is to persuade and inform your
		audience. This is why putting the big picture first, just like for the elevator
		pitch is crucial. Don’t neglect the visuals. Beautiful illustrations and tidy
		design can help develop your message.</p>
		<h3>
		Final word
	</h3>
	<p>
		Even though there is a gap between science and business, it does not
		mean one cannot belong to both. It may take some effort, just like
		learning to speak another language but learning to adapt to the business
		world can give you a lot of satisfaction and open the doors. So go out
		to the world, participate in the events organized by the industry and
		converse with them. Do not get taken by surprise at your dream
		job/internship interview, it would be dull to miss it because of the
		content ‘lost in translation’.
