	<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In a 4 months internship I contributed to a new project on biomarker screening with a novel classifier based on isotopic regression. The project involved: </p>
<ul>
		<li>testing several machine learning algorithms for benchmark</li>
		<li>improvement of a novel classifier based on isotopic regression</li>
		<li>working with complex multidimensional data </li>
		<li>involved in collaboration between experimental and theoretical team</li>
		<li>created basis for a PhD thesis </li>
		<li>biomedical: biomarkers detection </li>
		<li>master thesis evaluation: excellent</li>
	</ul>

<p>Since then, the project was taken over a PhD student and probably evolved significantly. Here is a graphical summary of my work.</p>
