	<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As a master student, I took part in an international competition of <b>Synthetic Biology</b> projects. As a part of an interdisciplinary team, I was using cutting-edge technology in order to design new generation products that would deal with unpleasant smell of human body, shown to accumulate on the skin of elder people. As far as I am concerned, I have been working on elimination of a molecule 2-nonenal that has very intense waxy cucumber-like smell. Our project was awarded at Giant iGEM Jamboree in Boston, MA with a <b>gold medal</b>, best <b>New Application project prize</b>, <b>Art & Design prize</b> and <b>Interlab Study mention</b>.</p>

<h3>What did I learn in iGEM?</h3>
<ul>
	<span class="image right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/igem_sepia.jpg" alt="" width=70% /></span>
	<li><b>Team work</b> is tough. People working in the team often have different background, different goals and different work pace. Discussion, compromise and forgiveness are keys to achieve goals of the project.</li>

	<li><b>Graphical design</b> is fun and not as hard as it seems. I have been introduced to basics of software for working vector images that serves me till today.</li>

	<li><b>Product design</b> - in iGEM we tried to deliver a very concrete outcome in a very short time. In our project the ultimate goal was to develop a series of cosmetics. Product would have to fulfill standards and norms for its category. It opened my eyes to project connected to science <b>outside of academic research</b></li>

	<li><b>Microbiology</b> - I have learned practical basics of work in a lab with bacterial cultures.</li>

	<li><b>Wet lab work</b> is hard. It demands a lot of time and good organization. Lab equipment is cost-full and easy to break. Work in a wet lab makes you train your concentration, planning and documentation.</li>
</ul>
