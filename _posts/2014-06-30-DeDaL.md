It is also possible to used DeDaL to visualize genetic information . We applied DeDaL to create a DDL layout for a group of yeast genes involved in DNA repair and replication. The genetic interactions between these genes and the epistatic profiles (computed only with respect to this group of genes) were used from [7]. The definitions of DNA repair pathways were taken from KEGG database [8]. Figure 4 shows the difference between application of the standard organic layout for this small network of genetic interactions and PCA-based DDL (computed here without applying data matrix double-centering to take into account tendencies of genes to interact with smaller or larger number of other genes). PCA- based DDL in this case groups the genes with respect to their epistatic profiles. Firstly, local hub genes RAD27 and POL32 have distinct position in this layout. Secondly, PCA-based DDL roughly groups the genes accordingly to the DNA repair pathway in which they are involved. For example, it shows that Non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway is closer to Homologous recombination (HR) pathway than to the Mismatch repair pathway. It also underlines that some homologous recombination genes (such as RDH54) are characterized by a different pattern of genetic interactions than the â€œcoreâ€ HR genes RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55,RAD57.

In the next example we apply DeDaL to the Boolean model of cell fate decisions between survival, apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death (such as necrosis) published in [9], to group the nodes of the influence diagram accordingly to their co-activation patterns in the logical steady states.
