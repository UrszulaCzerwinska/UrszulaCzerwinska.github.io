    <h2>
      Introduction: Empowering Women in Data Science and AI for Healthcare
    </h2>
    <p>
      In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving world, data science is driving innovation
      across industries, particularly in healthcare where AI and deep learning
      models are transforming patient outcomes. The
      <strong>Women in Healthcare Analytics and Data Science (WiHADS)</strong>
      initiative is leading the charge, empowering women in data science to
      spearhead crucial data science projects that are revolutionizing the
      healthcare sector.
    </p>
    <h2>The Beginnings of WiHADS: A Movement in Data Science and Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
      WiHADS began in 2017, spearheaded by
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameh-m-8575a3179/">Sameh Megrhi</a>,
      with a vision to amplify the voices of women in data science and
      healthcare analytics.<br />
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The initiative was created to address the underrepresentation of women
        in fields like deep learning models, data science and engineering, and
        AI in healthcare. By highlighting the significant contributions of
        women, WiHADS aims to inspire more women to enter and thrive in these
        critical sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its inception, WiHADS has brought together a healthcare data
        science community. The platform provides a space where women can share
        their experiences and insights, fostering a collaborative environment
        that encourages innovation in data science and machine learning. These
        meetups are not just about discussionsâ€”they are about solving real-world
        challenges using deep learning algorithms and data science
        methodologies.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>WiHADS Meetups: A Hub for Innovation in Data Science and Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
      WiHADS meetups have become a central platform for women in data science to
      exchange ideas, network, and discuss the latest trends in data science and
      machine learning. Since 2017, WiHADS has organized four major meetups in
      Paris, each focusing on the intersection of data science and healthcare.
      These events have garnered attention within the data science community and
      beyond, as they provide invaluable insights into how data science and deep
      learning AI are transforming the healthcare industry.
