  <p><strong><em>“Foundation models are models that are trained on broad data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. (…) In choosing this term, we take ‘foundation’ to designate the function of these models: a foundation is built first and it alone is fundamentally unfinished, requiring (possibly substantial) subsequent building to be useful. ‘Foundation’ also conveys the gravity of building durable, robust, and reliable bedrock through deliberate and judicious action.”</em></strong>

</span></p>

<p>In the competitive realm of digital commerce, embracing technological advancements is not a luxury but a necessity for maintaining success. Among ML tools, foundation models are emerging as a formidable force. But what are foundation models, and why have they become a focal point among technologists and business leaders?</p>

<p>As members of ‘Cognition’, a team dedicated to computer vision at <a href="https://adevinta.com/">Adevinta</a>, we are eager to share the insights we have gathered through our technology trends watch and recent attendance of the <a href="https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/">ICCV 2023</a> conference. This practice not only ensures our internal services remain up to date but also improves the standards experienced by our users, enhancing the services provided to customers across <a href="https://adevinta.com/our-brands">Adevinta’s brands</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-foundation-models">What are foundation models ?</h2>

<p><strong>Foundation models</strong> are a breed of artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on a vast amount of data, laying a robust groundwork for further customisation on specific tasks.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional machine learning models, which require from-scratch training or fine tuning for every new task, <strong>foundation models offer a substantial head start</strong>. They have already learned a good deal from the data they were initially trained on, which includes recognising patterns, objects, and in the domain of computer vision, even understanding the semantics of a scene.</p>

<p>Foundation models can be leveraged in various ways, each with its own balance of resource consumption and performance enhancement. The most resource-efficient method involves extracting features from an image, “freezing” them, and then using them directly as a zero-shot retrieval, classifier or detector. This zero-shot approach requires no further learning, allowing for immediate application.</p>

<p>Alternatively, these embeddings can serve as inputs to other models, such as an MLP or an XGBoost classifier, through transfer learning. This strategy necessitates a minimal training dataset, yet it remains swift and cost-effective. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07932">Pastore et al</a> reported that there can be <strong>10x to 100x speed increase</strong> coupled with limited accuracy decrease (1–5% on average), depending on the dataset, when using a kernel classifier on top of frozen features. For a well-known CIFAR100 dataset, the authors observed 10x to 12x speed increase and −3.70% accuracy decrease. From our preliminary experiments, preparing for deploying image embedding services for Adevinta marketplaces, we noted a 5x to 10x speed increase with less than 3% accuracy drop for ImageNet1K dataset with Dinov2 frozen features compared to fine tuning a CNN backbone.</p>

<p>For those seeking even greater performance enhancements, fine-tuning either the last layers or the entire network is an option. This process may demand a deeper understanding of machine learning and a larger dataset for model refinement, but can lead to substantial improvements. A key challenge in this approach is maintaining the model’s generalisability and preventing it from “forgetting” previously learned datasets.</p>

<p><span class="image fit">

</span></p>

<p>To further enrich the model with bespoke data, one can explore self-supervised learning techniques for pre-training or distillation on domain-specific data. Moreover, to ensure the model remains current with new data, continuous learning methodologies can be employed. These advanced techniques not only enhance the model’s performance, but also tailor it more closely to specific business needs and data environments.</p>

</span></p>

<p>Beyond the singular applications of foundation models lies the potential for a transformative synergy. By harnessing models trained on diverse datasets with various loss functions, we can unlock new heights of performance. This approach was masterfully demonstrated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00984?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=281785463&amp;utm_content=281787502&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Krishnan et al</a>, who capitalised on images synthesised by Stable Diffusion. They adeptly trained another model (StableRep) using a contrastive loss approach and ViT backbone to achieve remarkable success in a classification benchmark. This strategy showcases the innovative fusion of generative and discriminative model capabilities, setting a new standard for adaptive and robust AI applications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>“Different foundation models understand different aspects of the world. It’s exciting that a large diffusion model, which is good at generating images, can be used to train a large vision transformer, which is good at analysing images!”</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-foundation-models">The rise of foundation models</h2>

<p>The history of foundation models is closely tied to the rise of deep learning, particularly with the advent of large-scale models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, which demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of pre-training models on vast datasets and then fine-tuning them for specific tasks.</p>

<p>As technology advanced, so did the scale and capabilities of these models, with models like GPT-3, GPT-4 and T5 showcasing unprecedented levels of generalisation and adaptability across numerous domains including natural language processing, computer vision, and even multimodal tasks combining both vision and text. The success of these models started <strong>a new era where the focus shifted from training task-specific models from scratch to developing robust, versatile foundation models.</strong> This new type of model could be fine-tuned or used in transfer-learning to excel at a broad spectrum of tasks. This shift not only catalysed significant advancements in AI research but also broadened adoption of AI across various industries, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable foundation models that continue to push the boundaries of what’s achievable with Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>Notable examples of foundation models abound in the tech landscape. For instance, DINOv2 and MAE (Masked Autoencoder) by Meta AI for image understanding. On the other hand, models like CLIP and BLIP from OpenAI have shown the potential of bridging the gap between vision and language. These models, pre-trained on diverse and voluminous datasets, encapsulate a broad spectrum of knowledge that can be adapted for more specialised tasks, making them particularly advantageous for industries with data-rich environments like e-commerce.</p>

<p>The tech titans, often bundled as GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple), alongside several other companies such as Hugging Face, Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Cohere, Aleph Alpha, Open AI and Salesforce have been instrumental in developing, utilising and advancing foundation models. Substantial investments in these models underscore their potential, as these corporations harness foundation models to augment various facets of their operations, setting a benchmark for <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2021/10/18/reflections.html#:~:text=Simultaneously%2C%20in%20industry%2C%20several%20startups,that%20impact%20billions%20of%20people">other sectors</a>.</p>

<p>Insights from industry leaders at <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/foundation-models-2022s-ai-paradigm-shift/#:~:text=Foundation%20models%20like%20DALL,computer%20science%20%20department%20at">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/accelerate-foundation-models-research-fall-2023/#:~:text=About%20the%20program,society%20while%20mitigating%20risks">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/foundation-models">IBM</a>, alongside academic institutions, provide a rich tapestry of knowledge and perspectives​.</p>

<p>Percy Liang, a director of the Center for Research on Foundation Models, emphasised in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/foundation-models-ai-standards-stanford">this article</a> that foundation models like DALL-E and GPT-3 herald new creative opportunities and novel interaction mechanisms with systems, showcasing the innovation that these models can bring to the table. He also mentions potential risks of such powerful models​.</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/">ICCV 2023 conference</a>, held this year in Paris, foundation models were a very present topic. William T. Freeman, Professor of Computer Science, MIT, talked about the foundation models in his talk in <a href="https://gkioxari.github.io/Tutorials/iccv2023/">QUO VADIS Computer Vision</a> workshop. He cited reasons why he <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HfSrxSMS54c6-rYQNKBZnqgk_eRYqwOx/view">does not like foundation models</a> as an academic:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>They don’t tell us how vision works.</em></li>
  <li><em>They’re not fundamental (and therefore not stable)</em></li>
  <li><em>They separate academia from industry</em></li>
</ol>

<p>This highlights the importance of foundation models for the future of computer vision and their established position and pragmatic aspect of those models focusing on performance.</p>

<p>IBM Research posits that <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/foundation-models">foundation models will significantly expedite AI adoption</a> in business settings. The general applicability of these models, enabled through self-supervised learning and fine-tuning, allows for a wide range of AI applications, thereby accelerating AI deployment across various business domains​.</p>

<p>Microsoft Research highlights that foundation models are instigating <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/foundation-models">a fundamental shift in computing research</a> and across various scientific domains. This shift is underpinned by the models’ ability to fuel industry-led advances in AI, thereby contributing to a vibrant and diverse research ecosystem that’s poised to unlock the promise of AI for societal benefit while addressing associated risks.</p>

<p>Experts also underscore the critical role of computer vision foundation models in solving real-world applications, emphasising their <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2021/10/18/reflections.html#:~:text=Simultaneously%2C%20in%20industry%2C%20several%20startups,that%20impact%20billions%20of%20people">adaptability to a myriad of downstream</a> tasks due to training on diverse, large-scale datasets​. Moreover, foundation models like CLIP <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">enable zero-shot learning</a>, allowing for versatile applications like classifying video frames, identifying scene changes and building semantic image search engines without necessitating prior training.</p>

<p>In another workshop of ICCV 2023, <a href="https://bigmac-vision.github.io/">BigMAC</a>: Big Model Adaptation for Computer Vision, the <a href="https://bigmac-vision.github.io/pdfs/ludwig.pdf">robustness of the CLIP model</a> on the popular ImageNet benchmark was discussed. In conclusion, thanks to training on a large, versatile dataset means that zero-shot predictions of the CLIP model are less vulnerable to data drift than popular CNN models trained and fine tuned on imageNet. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiouM3MEOKs&amp;t=4546s">recording of Ludwig’s presentation</a> different ways to preserve CLIP robustness while fine-tuned are discussed.</p>

<p>On a side note, the ICCV conference was quite an event. With five days of workshops, talks and demos! Big tech companies such as Meta marked their presence with impressive hubs, answering attendees’ questions. Numerous poster sessions gave us a chance to interact with authors and select some ideas we would like to contribute to the tech stack at Adevinta.</p>

<p>In the subsequent sections, we will dig into real-world instances, underscoring their impact on e-commerce and elaborate how investing in this technology can galvanise collaboration and innovation across various teams within a company.</p>

<p>Investing in foundation models for computer vision in e-commerce does entail upfront costs such as acquiring computational resources and the requisite expertise. OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, for example, reportedly cost $4.6M to train. According to another OpenAI report, the cost of training a large AI model is <a href="https://encord.com/blog/visual-foundation-models-vfms-explained/#:~:text=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT%2D3%20model%2C%20for%20example%2C%20reportedly%20cost%20%244.6MM%20to%20train.%20According%20to%20another%20OpenAI%20report%2C%20the%20cost%20of%20training%20a%20large%20AI%20model%20is%20projected%20to%20rise%20from%20%24100MM%20to%20%24500MM%20by%202030.">projected to rise</a> from $100M to $500M by 2030.</p>

<p>However, the potential benefits could justify the investment. For instance, the <strong>global visual search market,</strong> which is significantly powered by computer vision technology, is projected to reach <strong>$15 billion by 2023</strong>. Early adopters who incorporate visual search on their platforms could see <a href="https://blog.taskmonk.ai/what-role-will-computer-vision-play-in-the-future-of-ecommerce/#:~:text=Early%20adopters%20who%20incorporate%20visual,of%20their%20online%20shopping%20experience"><strong>revenues increase by 30%</strong></a>. The computer vision market itself is soaring with an expected <strong>annual growth rate of 19.5%</strong>, predicted to reach a value of $100.4 billion by 2023​<a href="https://encord.com/blog/visual-foundation-models-vfms-explained/#:~:text=April%2024%2C%202023%20%E2%80%A2%205,9Bn%20in%202022">​</a>.</p>

<p>These figures suggest that the integration of computer vision, particularly through foundation models, can be a lucrative venture in the long-term.

<h2 id="challenges-and-overcoming-strategies">Challenges and overcoming strategies</h2>

<p>Incorporating foundation models for computer vision within an e-commerce setting comes with a range of challenges, but with the right strategies, these hurdles can be navigated to unlock the models’ full potential.</p>

<h2 id="computational-requirements">Computational requirements</h2>

<p>Foundation models are computationally intensive due to their large-scale nature, which necessitates <a href="https://snorkel.ai/foundation-models/#:~:text=Cost,for%20their%20end%20use%20caes">significant computational resources</a> for training and fine-tuning. The good news is that, once the substantial work of domain-learning or fine tuning is done, numerous teams and projects can benefit from the foundation model with minimal additional effort and cost.</p>

<h2 id="bias-andfairness">Bias and fairness</h2>

<p>Foundation models may inherit biases present in the training data, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory behaviour. For instance, <a href="https://datagen.tech/blog/the-opportunities-and-risks-of-foundation-models/">DALL-E and CLIP have shown biases</a> regarding gender and race when generating images or interpreting text and images​. Implementing robust data preprocessing and bias mitigation strategies will help to address potential biases in training data.</p>

<h2 id="interpretability-andcontrol">Interpretability and control</h2>

<p>Understanding and controlling the behaviour of foundation models like CLIP remains a challenge due to their black-box nature. This makes it difficult to interpret the models’ predictions, which is a hurdle in applications where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">explainability is crucial</a>​​. CRFM released recently a <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=280825441&amp;utm_content=280827829&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Foundation Model Transparency Index</a> “scoring 10 popular models on how well their makers disclosed details of their training, characteristics and use.”</p>

<p>Foundation models, if widely adopted, could introduce <strong>single points of failure</strong> in machine learning systems. If adversaries find vulnerabilities in a foundation model, they could <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11251">exploit these weaknesses</a> across multiple systems utilising the same model​.</p>

<p>Foundation models are <strong>not the answer to all</strong> machine learning problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>“Foundation models are neither ‘foundational’ nor the foundations of AI. We deliberately chose ‘foundation’ rather than ‘foundational,’ because we found that ‘foundational’ implied that these models provide fundamental principles in a way that ‘foundation’ does not. (…) Further, ‘foundation’ describes the (role of) model and not AI; we neither claim nor believe that foundation models alone are the foundation of AI, but instead note they are ‘only one component (though an increasingly important component) of an AI system.’”</em></strong></p>
