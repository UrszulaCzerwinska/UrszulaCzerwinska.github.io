      <i><strong>Big data - big unknown</strong></i>
    </p>
    <h2>When we play with data that are not so big...</h2>
    <p>
      Experience with big data is among top skills of a data scientist profile.
      However, it is not trivial to learn big data tools without necessary
      infrastructure and proper tutoring. While pursuing my PhD in Data science
      dealing with medium size data frames (< 1G), usually all can be processed
      on one machine. In order to get some taste of methods and challenges of
      Big Data, I completed
      <a href="http://www.bigdive.eu/" target="_blank">Big Dive</a> course
      organized by
      <a href="https://www.top-ix.org/en/home-eng/" target="_blank">TOP-IX</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>... but we want to get a taste of <strong>BIG data</strong></h3>

          >Image rights TOP-IX</em
        ></span
      >
      During the intense 5-week course I put in practice my Python - pandas
      skills and learned new libraries for <b>distributed computing</b>, as well
      as <i>Py<b>Spark</b></i> basics. We also spent a significant amount of
      time setting up the infrastructure on
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/?nc2=h_lg" target="_blank"
        >amazon aws</a
      >
      and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank"><b>MongoDB</b></a
      >. Invited keynote speakers showed us important aspects and challenges of
      the data science for <b>business and science</b>. A bonus was an
      introduction to beautiful <b>visualization D3.js</b>. Finally, for me the
      most interesting and important part of the course was a
      <b>project</b> realized for one of 3 companies:

      industry.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal highlights</h3>
    <p>
      <li>
        <b>D3.js</b> is a very powerful tool for data visualization but its
        learning curve is quite steep. Learning jquery and communication with a
        remote data server, basics of web design are necessary to create a
        serious final product. So if you don't want to spend a significant
        amount of time learning all the toolkit better go for pre-set solutions
        like RShiny if you know R for instance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dask</b> library seems to be an interesting alternative to Spark for
        smaller projects, the big plus is that it is using pandas vocabulary. It
        can be also misleading as we encountered quite a lot of problems
        building a set up for our data, lots of ram memory seems to be necessary
        and understanding how dask is dealing with our objects differently than
        pandas is crucial for a successful application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spark</b> contains important differences in algorithms from R or
        scikit-learn implementations. Therefore testing locally and comparing to
        the distributed version is not a good idea and difference in performance
        can be significant. It is important to keep it in mind from the
        beginning of the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Github</b> has some really cool project management features like
        issues system and wiki. Usually, it is not extensively used in academia
        or only as a code repository while for us the management part was really
        useful and handy to organize work. If you are a student you can get a
        <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank"
          >Student Developer Pack for free</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <b>field expert</b> is an important part of the team. His needs should
        guide the analysis, it helps to make data scientist work really useful
        in the domain of its application
