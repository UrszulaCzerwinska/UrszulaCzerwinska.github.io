        <title>Career transition - from academia to industry</title>
        <description>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/style&gt;
 
      &lt;/body&gt;  
&lt;section&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Ph. D. and what after? Do you know?&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For most of us, a natural choice after completing a science masters is a research career. The path is clear: a Ph.D., followed perhaps by an international postdoc and then a faculty position, and you become a PI or a Professor. However, some of us (including me) at different stages of this long path are asking ourselves a question: &lt;strong&gt;do I really fit here?&lt;/strong&gt; At this point, some people may choose to abandon research for non-research work they may find more fulfilling, better-paid, more entertaining or less stressful. These people may make the transition into science liaison, editor, consultant or project manager positions. Others may find happiness in continuing with research, &lt;strong&gt;but in industry setting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;From two &lt;i&gt;Birds of Flight&lt;/i&gt; sessions: Student Council Career Central and Navigating the Industry Career Path at ISMB 2016, I have  compiled various testimonies about doing research in industry and some tips for applicants seeking out those positions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/carrer_un1_Fotor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;In brief, the difference between industry and academia is :&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academia&lt;/strong&gt;: how can I generate new informantion that will improve world knowledge? Personal career is often ahead of the main goal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a specific problem we need to try to solve as quickly as we can working as a team&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Main differences between working in industry and in academia:&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;faster peace — This can be a plus (stimulating) or a minus (stressful) depending on your working style or personal preference.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;real deadlines — A lot of money can be invested in projects you are part of and so there is pressure to achieve goals or abandon projects where necessary&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;constructive feedback — For example, at the end of the year the &lt;i&gt;Amyris&lt;/i&gt; company gives employees &lt;strong&gt;feedback&lt;/strong&gt; on different competences. This is based on what is collected from their co-workers and project leaders, and can include evaluations on communication (written and oral), individual performance , performance in the team, leadership skills, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;improve your skills with the aid of the company- i.e. Your oral presentation may be recorded and commented in detail to help you overcome your weak points&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;your manager is not a PI - Your relationships within the working environment will therefore be different&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;less competition, more &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; between research groups within the company&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;working hours — Within industry employees can be expensive: you need to learn to be very efficient during your allocated working hours&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;put aside your ego —  Being capable of working well within a team is crucial, &lt;strong&gt;no one wants to work with a super-star&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;you don’t need to raise &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; — there is typically a whole department that takes care of this, you are free to focus on research&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;less &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt; on your research and goals - as the topic of your research and goals are typically led by the company&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;you may still be able to publish research, but it is not a high priority like in Academia - Lawyers may decide what you can actually make public&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;you can and you should still network with researchers - Probably your ex-fellows&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;you can collaborate with academic labs&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;your creation belongs to the company — No fights to have your name on the paper, but on the other hand, you do not get credit in the traditional sense&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;your work and the company can be motivated by money&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/career_un_5_Fotor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Some tips for the job search and interview process&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;h4 &gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;Key tips&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;i&gt;Team work, team work, team work.&lt;/i&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Industry is probably not suited to individuals who would prefer to work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		According to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nicole.bodycombe@pfizer.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicole Bodycombe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/href&gt;, technical skills are not the most important point of your dossier because she argues that everyone can be trained. What is much more important is the ability to &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with coworkers and community and also &lt;strong&gt;problem solve&lt;/strong&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;Interview process&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Different stages can be applied: CV screening — make sure it stands out for example including recommendation letter from some in the company, phone screening, group lunch (evaluate your social skills), pairing, a task/ exercise / problem to solve (result is not the most important the process of searching for an answer is)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your homework&lt;/strong&gt; before the interview: see products, related publications, try to get in contact with someone in the company through your network to learn about company habits, goals and ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Use interview to &lt;strong&gt;learn more about the company&lt;/strong&gt;. What is the working environment like? What kind of vocabulary do they use? Always ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;You can read testimonies from applicants who have interviewed for different companies online in websites as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.fr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.glassdoor.fr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;Your role in the industry&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			For a computational biologist different roles are possible: data analyst, software engineer (producing tools), project-shaping. Along with many others! Sometimes you can negotiate with the company about your role, but try to flexible and open into new opportunities.

		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;How to network?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Most of people you know may stay in academia. It is likely that your PI will be able to offer you more advice on continuing your career is academia than they would be able to about pursuing one in industry. &lt;strong&gt;So how can you meet people from the big world outside of academia?&lt;/strong&gt; Look among your colleagues, it is likely that there is someone who has at least collaborated with industry partners. You can also use Linkedin to find more people working within industry. Reach out to people and go to local meet ups. &lt;strong&gt;Be curious and proactive&lt;/strong&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;PostDoc or not?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			For those who are debating between getting more experience in research before transitioning into industry or moving straight across, the answer is: &lt;strong&gt;it depends&lt;/strong&gt;. For more skill based positions like data analysts or developers it is not necessary to have an extensive research background. However if you wish to lead a research group in industry it can be an asset to have progressed further in academia.
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlightme&quot;&gt;Important remark: If you are &lt;strong&gt;not U.S. resident&lt;/strong&gt; looking to land an industry job in U.S., it may be better for you to do a postdoc first for practical reasons. Getting a working visa from a distance can be a long and difficult process and having a research position can make it easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;h4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#999999&quot;&gt;What if I want to go back to academia?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Well, it may be challenging but certainly not impossible. Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjudithblake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Judith Blake&lt;/a&gt; made it. The key is to keep contact with academiaby attending conferences and keeping up to date with new research. However, it may be more challenging to obtain positions that look at your impact factor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;hr /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To sum up, in order to succeed in securing jobs in academia, (according to our experts) you should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be open to opportunities and enjoy yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/carrer_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;From left to right: Nicole Bodycombe, Blake Borgeson, Lan Hu, Scott Markel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The experts that contributed the testimonials that make up the basis for this post were: Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/amoolyasingh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amoolya Singh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amyris.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amyrisc Inc&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-teichmann-9975646b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Teichmann&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/teichmann&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Group Leader at EBI&lt;/a&gt;), Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithblake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Judith Blake&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/judy-blake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jaxon Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, previous: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.si.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Smithsonian Institution&lt;/a&gt;), Mrs. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nicole.bodycombe@pfizer.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nicole Bodycombe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfizer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:blake.borgeson@recursionpharma.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blake Borgeson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recursionpharma.com/team.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RECURSION Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;), Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hulan0@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lan Hu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bio-rad.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bio-Rad Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;)and Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Scott.MARKEL@3ds.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scott Markel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://accelrys.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BIOVIA&lt;/a&gt;). All of the above (except Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-teichmann-9975646b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Teichmann&lt;/a&gt;) were or are working an industry setting with research being a key component of what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Some of them chose to leave academia because of personal situations, working hours (industry jobs can sometimes be less time-consuming) or in an effort to have a better work-life balance. Their testimonies highlight that there are many varied and exciting opportunities within industry.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;hr /&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personally, as I strongly consider working in industry later on in my life.&lt;/strong&gt;Even though these testimonies are somewhat limited in the sense that this is only a snapshot of some people’s experience, they give an idea about the industry sector’s expectations and the benefits of working there.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Sadly there is no magic recipe for choosing between academia and industry. &lt;strong&gt;Finding the right job is like buying shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; Some are exactly the right fit and some you may need to adjust a bit. The key is to try as many as possible and to be well-prepared. Thanks to an increasing number of career development sessions at scientific conferences, more people will be able to explore their options and contribute to research in the best way they can — be that working in academia or in industry.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish you all best of luck with your career!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Student Council Symposium at Orlando</title>
        <description>&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Student Council Symposium at Orlando #SCSOrlando2016&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started off ISMB2016 by attending the Student Council Symposium. This meeting is dedicated to students, post docs, and young researchers in the fields of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and it gave me a chance to present my work with an oral presentation and a poster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day started with an Ice Breaking event:&lt;strong&gt; Scientific speed dating. &lt;/strong&gt;We were given a few minutes to get introduced to other person present in the room. Despite myself (and many others) being massively jet-lagged, it was quite entertaining and it gave us the impression that you were continuing the day with friends, instead of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/jq_Fotor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;First keynote speaker&lt;/strong&gt;: John Quackenbush, professor of Computational Biology and Biology and Bioinformatics, talked to us about some of his main research lines these days entitled &lt;em&gt;Networks from gentoype to phenotype.&lt;/em&gt; The main highlight of his talk was his network-based analysis coupled with transcriptomic and mutation data. He introduced an approach where he constructed networks specific to patients and then he compared their structure described in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06440&quot; data-href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06440&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Estimating sample-specific regulatory networks&lt;/a&gt;”. He then criticized some of classical approaches calling them a ‘bio-poetry’. He also gave us quick overview of his approach to SNPs and eQTLs. He then went on to describe how important interdisciplinarity when working in computational biology is, using the example of implementing matrix formulation from quantum physics to describe network transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were &lt;strong&gt;15 students presenting&lt;/strong&gt; for 15minutes each. This years most represented topics were protein structure reconstruction and sequence analysis. Some students shared their reflection on being in between two disciplines: biology &amp;amp; computer science. I personally found all talks very well prepared, most of speakers were clear and interesting. The participants came from different countries all around the world and some, like me, made it thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://symposium.iscbsc.org/tf-announcement&quot; data-href=&quot;http://symposium.iscbsc.org/tf-announcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISCB travel fellowship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/jt_Fotor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;The second keynote&lt;/strong&gt; talk was given by Janet Thornton. She is Director Emeritus of EMBL-EBI and Senior Scientist, with scientific interest in protein structure. She not only shared with us an overview of her career path and research, but also personal reflections on different steps of her life: student, post-doc, PI. She left us with lots of very useful tips. She is a very warm and humble person and is a great example for many researchers. She expressed her belief that computational biology is an expanding field and that this will create job opportunities for young researchers. She was very passionate and happy about her unexpected career path she made from physics to computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/advice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elsevier, the sponsor of SCS, prepared also for us a special demo of their new product &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pathway-studio-biological-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pathway Studio&lt;/a&gt; and offered us a free trial! They were very patient guiding us through their step-by-step tutorial and answering numerous questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Symposium ended with a &lt;strong&gt;poster session &lt;/strong&gt;which was accompanied with some snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants then voted for the best poster and talk. The winners are to announced on Monday during ISCB Town Hall (!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were also invited to closing &lt;strong&gt;social event&lt;/strong&gt; when we could talk to our peers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SCS was for me a great start to my trip. It was great to see other passionate students and discuss engaging research topics. Hope to cross paths with them again over the course of the main ISMB conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the SCS, I still had some time to explore the Swan &amp;amp; Dolphin hotel area. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hote.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Learning business at Sorbonne</title>
        <description>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy, Finance and Marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; Why should I care about them if I am a Ph. D. student? Leave stereotypes behind and find out.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;What is CBA?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Certificate in Business and Administration is a course organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cfdip.uspc.fr/fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CFDiP&lt;/a&gt; for students of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sorbonne-paris-cite.fr/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Université Sorbonne Paris Cité&lt;/a&gt;. It has been inspired by best American Universities that propose CBA for their graduate students. It is happening in two steps of 7 and 5 days separated by 6 months. Entirely in English, CBA targets motivated Ph. D. students from different fields that are interested in pursuing their career outside of academia. It fills the gap in the current educational system that not prepare STEM students to land jobs in private sector. The program not only gives an overview of how company and business works. But, even more importantly gives an on-hand experience in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capsim.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Capsim Business Simulator&lt;/a&gt; as it is done in top Business Schools. Here is a snapshot of the first week of the CBA challenge. Check also  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23CBAsorbonne&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#CBASorbonne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PxGirard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@px.girard&lt;/a&gt;. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/strategy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
        Why companies pay consultants? What make a company grow and develop and other go bankrupt in the same environment? These were questions our teacher and the course coordinator &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:px.girard@gmail.com&quot;&gt;Pierre Girard&lt;/a&gt; addressed in his lecture about strategy. We learned how to analyze environment through PESTEL on a real-life study cases. We were also introduced also to ethics and the life cycle of companies. This gave us a general overview of what external factors weight most for company success and what matters we can face one working in or running a firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Finance&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;image left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/finance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Second day was scarified to financial matters. Jiri Tresl explained us the difference between accounting and finance where the first one is the module providing information and the second taking decision and thus they both are inseparable to run a company. 
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Finance is an art of money management&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        We have been introduced to the whole new vocabulary: assets, investments, cash, liability, equity, shares, stocks, bonds and debts. We learned basic rules determining these alien world. Since  then we will all remember that 
                &lt;blockquote&gt;profit does NOT equal cash&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        This class really served us to understand how to manage finance of our virtual company in CAPSIM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;!

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/CCosine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finally &#39;the key to business success&#39; - marketing. With dynamic Christine Coisne we went trough tactics and concepts. We studied evolution of company LEGO what is the difference between Transactional  and relational marketing, how to perform SWOT analysis and targets differentiation. Now for sure, we will not take &#39;marketing mix&#39; for a name of a drink and we will not think Maslow was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;They made it!&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meeting people that made career transition&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Maureen Alivon&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She has a bachelor in biology and master in pharmacology. She worked in a lab of Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou about the effects of antiangiogenic drugs on large arteries elastic properties and she got the CBA certificate during her Ph.D. And after her Ph. D. she was asking herself a question what to do. She decided to look for a job outside of academia. However it was not easy. She has sent lots of CV. She event went though interview process to hear she cannot work in marketing because she has no experience. A situation we probably hear about. Finally, 3 months after her Ph. D. defense she got recommended for Medical Communication Manager in Servier. And she enjoys her job a lot. She shared with us some tips answered generously our questions. At first place, she highlighted that Ph. D. is a big thing and everything we will learn about time and work management will be useful in our future job. She advised not to wait for engage career transition. Faster the better, in order to build our professional network. She admitted she was not good with social media and not engaged in associative activities but it can definitely help to get a job. Even though she is not continuing on making experiments and she cannot publish, she highly appreciate her actual position and she is climbing up on the corporate ladder becoming project manager in upcoming month. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Noemie Ballot&lt;/h4&gt; 
                &lt;p&gt;She is now a manager of European Project Green Nano Films and in parallel works for a start-up. She told us her way from Ph.D. in Material Chemistry to project management. She found her job thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelliagence.fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABG L&#39;intelli&#39;agence&lt;/a&gt;. She said the CBA experience gave her curiosity to learn more about management, leadership, teamwork, finance budget and helped her to practice English. As Maureen she highlighted importance of building a professional network early in the career. She said we need to talk about our job search to everyone around, use social media. She encouraged us to just talk about what we do with passion and project ourselves in different jobs with our motivation and skills, to be confident and open-minded. She listed for us some possible jobs after Ph.D.:
                
                        &lt;ul&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;R&amp;D&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;research in companies&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;science monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;patents&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;leadership consulting&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;research projects management&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;science communication&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;scientific editor&lt;/li&gt;

                        &lt;/ul&gt;

                    She shared also some platforms we can look for job:
                &lt;ul&gt;
                            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelliagence.fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABG L&#39;intelli&#39;agence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Nesrine Benyahia&lt;/h4&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Our last guest Nesrine is still a Ph. D. student in health law while working for a start up  - consulting firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmcconsultingfrance.wix.com/bmcconsulting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMC Consulting&lt;/a&gt; she founded together  with two friends with law and business backgrounds. We asked her how she manages to carry on her Ph. D. and work at the same time. She confirmed it is not easy to have several tasks and that she works everywhere, in the metro, on weekends etc. but it is worth the hassle. 
            &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;CAPSIM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Business Simulation&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The most exciting part of the course was a competition in CAPSIM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; business simulator. For 4 days, six teams of 5-6 members managing each a B2B company producing sensors. There are five main sectors and each team starts with one product in one sector: High End, Low End, Traditional, Size and Performance. We had to manage R&amp;D, Marketing, Production and Finance. The competition was on for 6 rounds I was in Digby team with 4 great fellows: Clara, Rawan, Charlotte and Nirmal. I will share with you some of our strategy
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Round 0&lt;/strong&gt; 
        &lt;br&gt;
        In the round 0 we had a chance to learn how to use the simulation and test some strategies. We decided to create a new product in High End as the age was the most important criterion for this sector. To estimate how much money we need to borrow and how many units we need produce we made positive and negatives estimations. We quickly realized that releasing new product is really costly and doesn&#39;t bring returns for at least 2 rounds. On the top it makes impossible to improve other products because R&amp;D works on the new products. We also took too much debt and we sold out on some products. We have seen also powerful impact of marketing where a similar product would sold much better if its awareness and accessibility were high. We tried not to repeat the errors form round 0 in the competition. 

         &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Rounds 1-3&lt;/strong&gt; 
        &lt;br&gt;
        We made strategic decision not to introduce a new product. We decided to put our efforts and money in improving existing products, 2-3 in one round so that they are done before the end of the year. We also invested some money in automation and the maximum we could into marketing, but keeping in mind the cumulative margin of all products should be more than 30%. We based our estimations of produced units on best case estimation and our finance on the worst case estimation so that we don&#39;t need the emergency loan (because it has a very high percent). We were doing well growing slowly, but Andrew company was growing very fast and would probably take over in the round 4. 
 &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Rounds 4-6&lt;/strong&gt; 
        &lt;br&gt;
        Unfortunately I could not stay in the class, but my colleagues informed me about the sort of our company. They took lots of risk in the round 4 in order to overcompete Andrew, they lowered down prices and they invested a lot in marketing. But it didn&#39;t work very well because all competitors lowered prices! Since then they went back to initial strategy. They tried make their products close to perfect and also invested in automation to increase the margin. With this strategy they finished first!!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/capsim_res.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Team work&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/team.jpg-large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        I have a great chance to work in a team where decision making was not a big problem. Most of emotion raised the debate about introducing or not a new product. We manage to discuss and decided together. It was probably not the case for all teams. CAPSIM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; simulation is a great exercise of team work and tested our capability of debate and decision making. 
       
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The CBA course is great opportunity to get some glimpse of corporate life during a Ph. D. It helps to have general culture of enterprise, helps to develop logical thinking. The business simulations gives some brief hands on. But probably most importantly is an unique chance to meet great people that are in the same mindset and that can mutually help each other in career development. I cannot wait to the second part of the course in February 2017. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;Practical info&lt;/h6&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In order to apply to CBA check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cfdip.uspc.fr/fr/formations/catalogue-des-formations/metiers-entreprises-autres-organisations/innovation-entreprise/item/199-certificate-in-business-and-administration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;webpage of the course&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to used DeDaL to visualize genetic information . We applied DeDaL to create a DDL layout for a group of yeast genes involved in DNA repair and replication. The genetic interactions between these genes and the epistatic profiles (computed only with respect to this group of genes) were used from [7]. The definitions of DNA repair pathways were taken from KEGG database [8]. Figure 4 shows the difference between application of the standard organic layout for this small network of genetic interactions and PCA-based DDL (computed here without applying data matrix double-centering to take into account tendencies of genes to interact with smaller or larger number of other genes). PCA- based DDL in this case groups the genes with respect to their epistatic profiles. Firstly, local hub genes RAD27 and POL32 have distinct position in this layout. Secondly, PCA-based DDL roughly groups the genes accordingly to the DNA repair pathway in which they are involved. For example, it shows that Non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway is closer to Homologous recombination (HR) pathway than to the Mismatch repair pathway. It also underlines that some homologous recombination genes (such as RDH54) are characterized by a different pattern of genetic interactions than the â€œcoreâ€ HR genes RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55,RAD57.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next example we apply DeDaL to the Boolean model of cell fate decisions between survival, apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death (such as necrosis) published in [9], to group the nodes of the influence diagram accordingly to their co-activation patterns in the logical steady states. The tabl&lt;/p&gt;
