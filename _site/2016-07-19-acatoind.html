	<h3>Ph. D. and what after? Do you know?</h3>
	<p><i>For most of us, a natural choice after a science master is a research career. Path is straight: Ph. D., international postDocs and then a faculty position, maybe a PI or a Professor. However, some of us (including me) at different stages of this long path are asking ourselves a question: do I really fit here? Then, some people will abandon research for any other non-research work they find more fulfilling, better-paid, more entertaining or less stressful. Some will make a difficult career transition into science liaison, editor, consultant or project manager. And some might find happiness carrying on doing research, but in industry setting.</i></p>

	<p>From two <i>Birds of Flight</i>sessions: Student Council Career Central and Navigating the Industry Career Path at ISMB 2016, I have put together essence of testimonies about doing research in industry and some tips for applicants to those positions.</p>

	<div><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/advice.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>

	<p>In brief, the difference between industry and academia is :<br><blockquote><strong>academia</strong>: how can I generate new informantion that will improve world knowledge; personal career is often ahead of the main goal <br><strong>industry</strong>: there is a specific problem we try to solve as quickly as we can working as a team</blockquote></p>
	<h3>Main differences between working in industry and in academia:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>faster peace — can be plus (stimulating) or minus (stressful) depending on your personality</li>
		<li>real deadlines — big money depends on you and you need to achieve a goal or abandon</li>
		<li>true constructive feedback — i.e. in <i>Amyris</i> company at the end of the year employees receive <strong>feedback</strong> on diferent competences collected from their co-workers, up to evaluation are communication (written and oral), individual performance , performance in the team, leadership skills, etc.</li>
		<li>company helps you improve your skills- i.e. your oral presentation will be recorded and commented in detail to help you overcome your weak points</li>
		<li>your manager is not a PI, your relations with working environment will be different</li>
		<li>less competition, more <strong>collaboration</strong> between research groups within the company</li>
		<li>working hours — in industry employee is expensive: you need to learn to be very efficient during your working time, as a reward you have all your time after office hours</li>
		<li>you need to put your ego in your back pocket — capability of working in team is crucial, <strong>no one wants to work with a super-star</strong></li>
		<li>you don’t need to raise <strong>money</strong> — there is a whole department that takes care of it, you can focus on research</li>
		<li>you have less <strong>freedom</strong> for the topic of your research and goals are well defined</li>
		<li>sometimes you can still publish, but it is not the most important (lawyers will decide what you can actually make public)</li>
		<li>you can and you should still network with researchers (probably your ex-fellows)</li>
		<li>you can collaborate with academic labs</li>
		<li>your creation belongs to the company — no fights to have your name on the paper, but on the other hand, you get no credits</li>
		<li>your work translates into money (in your salary and for the company)</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Some tips for holders of Ph. D. or Post Docs about the job search and interview process</h3>
	<h4>Generalities</h4>
	<p>
		<i>Team work, team work, team work.</i>
	</p>
	<p>Industry is not for loners.</p>
	<p>
		According to <a href="mailto:nicole.bodycombe@pfizer.com" target="_blank">Nicole Bodycombe</href>, the technical skills are not the most important point of your dossier because everyone can be trained. Much more important are ability to <strong>communicate</strong> with coworkers and community and also <strong>problem solving</strong>.
	</p>

		<h4>Interview process</h4>
		<p>Different stages can be applied: CV screening — make sure it stands out for example including recommendation letter from some in the company, phone screening, group lunch (evaluate your social skills), pairing, a task/ exercise / problem to solve (result is not the most important the process of searching for an answer is)</p>
		<p><strong>Do your homework</strong> before the interview: see products, related publications, try to get in contact with someone in the company through your network to learn about company habits, goals and ambiance.</p>
		<p>Use interview to <strong>learn about the company</strong>. What are their gestures and vocabulary, dress code. Ask questions!</p>
		<p>You can read testimonies from interviews in different companies in websites as <a href="https://www.glassdoor.fr" target="_blank">https://www.glassdoor.fr</a>.</p>

		<h4>Your role in the industry</h4>
		<p>
			For a computational biologist different roles are possible: data analyst, software engineer (producing tools), project-shaping. Sometimes you can negotiate with the company, but try to flexible and open into new opportunities.
		</p>

		<h4>How to network?</h4>
		<p>
			Most of people you know were, are and will stay in academia. Probably your PI will advise you on academic career because he or she has no experience with outside jobs. So how to meet people from the big world outside? Fist, look among your colleagues, there must be some who at leas collaborate with industry partners. Then, use linked in to find HR people. Go to local meet up. Try to make a connection. Be curious and proactive.
		</p>

		<h4>PostDoc or not?</h4>
		<p>
			For those who hesitate on getting more experience with research before jumping into an industry position, the answer is: it depends. For more skill based jobs like data analyst or developer is not necessary. To lead a research group in industry it can be an asset.
